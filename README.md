# Drupal Module: Alternate Titles

This module provides a view mode that shows alternate titles for content within a table, sorted alphabetically alongside the primary title. This includes updating the computed titles field when content is saved.

## Requirements

To use this module, you will need to have a field called field_computed_titles on the node content type that you want to display with alternate titles.

The view should be set up to have one computed title in each row of results.
